/**
 * This example demonstrates the use of addressable LEDs that respond to 
 * incoming  MIDI note events.
 * 
 * @boards  AVR, AVR USB, Teensy 3.x, ESP32
 * 
 * @note    You might lose incoming MIDI data while the LED strip is being 
 *          updated. To avoid this, don't use an Arduino UNO.  
 *          See <https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Interrupt-problems>
 * 
 * Connections  
 * -----------
 * 
 * - 2: Data pin of NeoPixel LED strip with at least 8 pixels.
 * 
 * Behavior
 * --------
 * 
 * If a MIDI Note On event for note 0x3C (C4 or middle C) is sent, the first LED
 * will light up, if a Note Off event for that note is sent, the LED will turn 
 * off.  
 * If a MIDI Note On event for note 0x3D (C#4) is sent, the second LED will 
 * light up, etc.  
 * (A Note On event with a velocity of zero also counts as a Note Off event.)
 * 
 * Mapping
 * -------
 * 
 * Route the MIDI output of a MIDI keyboard to the Arduino's MIDI input. Then
 * play a middle C and some notes above it on the keyboard.
