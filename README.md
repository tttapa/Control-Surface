# Control Surface

Control Surface is an Arduino library for building MIDI controllers and control
surfaces.

At its core, the library features a flexible [**MIDI abstraction layer**](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/d3/df7/midi-tutorial.html)
with support for serial **5-pin DIN** MIDI, MIDI over **USB**, MIDI over **BLE**, etc.
These MIDI interfaces are compatible with a wide range of Arduino boards
(a full table can be found [here](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/d8/d4a/md_pages_MIDI-over-USB.html))
and are useful in any Arduino MIDI project.

In addition to MIDI input/output, Control Surface also provides easy-to-use utilities
intended for building MIDI controllers, supporting controls that send MIDI messages
─ like potentiometers, push buttons, rotary encoders, etc. ─
and controls that react to incoming MIDI messages ─ LEDs, displays, and so on.
More advanced controls that combine MIDI input and output ─
such as [motorized faders](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface-Motor-Fader)
─ are supported as well.

In projects with large numbers of inputs and outputs, Control Surface allows you
to seamlessly add multiplexers, shift registers and other port expanders, and
treat them as if they were ordinary GPIO pins.

## Example usage

An extensive list of examples can be found [in the documentation](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/examples.html).
Below are a handful of simple examples that give an idea of how the Control
Surface library can be used.

**Example 1**: A complete sketch for a MIDI controller with a potentiometer that sends out MIDI
Control Change message can be written in just five lines of code:

```cpp
#include <Control_Surface.h>

USBMIDI_Interface midi;
CCPotentiometer pot { A0, MIDI_CC::General_Purpose_Controller_1 };

void setup() { Control_Surface.begin(); }
void loop() { Control_Surface.loop(); }
```

**Example 2**: Larger MIDI controllers can be implemented very easily as well, with clean and
easy to modify code.
The following sketch is for 8 potentiometers (connected using an analog
multiplexer) that send out MIDI Control Change messages over USB. A detailed
walkthrough of this example can be found on the [Getting Started](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/d5/d7d/md_pages_Getting-Started.html) page.

```cpp
#include <Control_Surface.h>  // Include the library
 
USBMIDI_Interface midi;  // Instantiate a MIDI Interface to use
 
// Instantiate an analog multiplexer
CD74HC4051 mux {
  A0,       // Analog input pin
  {3, 4, 5} // Address pins S0, S1, S2
};
 
// Create an array of CCPotentiometer objects that send out MIDI Control Change 
// messages when you turn the potentiometers connected to the 8 inputs of the mux.
CCPotentiometer volumePotentiometers[] {
  { mux.pin(0), { MIDI_CC::Channel_Volume, Channel_1 } },
  { mux.pin(1), { MIDI_CC::Channel_Volume, Channel_2 } },
  { mux.pin(2), { MIDI_CC::Channel_Volume, Channel_3 } },
  { mux.pin(3), { MIDI_CC::Channel_Volume, Channel_4 } },
  { mux.pin(4), { MIDI_CC::Channel_Volume, Channel_5 } },
  { mux.pin(5), { MIDI_CC::Channel_Volume, Channel_6 } },
  { mux.pin(6), { MIDI_CC::Channel_Volume, Channel_7 } },
  { mux.pin(7), { MIDI_CC::Channel_Volume, Channel_8 } },
};
 
void setup() {
  Control_Surface.begin();  // Initialize the Control Surface
}

void loop() {
  Control_Surface.loop();  // Update the Control Surface
}
```

**Example 3**: Control Surface also supports many types of MIDI inputs. 
For example, an LED that turns on when a MIDI Note On message for middle C is
received:
```cpp
#include <Control_Surface.h>

USBMIDI_Interface midi;
NoteLED led { LED_BUILTIN, MIDI_Notes::C(4) };

void setup() { Control_Surface.begin(); }
void loop() { Control_Surface.loop(); }
```

**Example 4**: Control Surface's MIDI interfaces can also be used directly, for example, to
implement a MIDI-over-USB to MIDI-over-BLE adapter:
```cpp
#include <Control_Surface.h>

// Instantiate MIDI over BLE and MIDI over USB interfaces
BluetoothMIDI_Interface midi_ble;
USBMIDI_Interface midi_usb;
// Pipes allow routing between MIDI interfaces
BidirectionalMIDI_Pipe pipes;

void setup() {
  // Route the MIDI input from the USB interface to the BLE interface,
  // and the MIDI input from the BLE interface to the USB interface
  midi_usb | pipes | midi_ble;
  // Initialize the MIDI interfaces
  MIDI_Interface::beginAll();
}

void loop() {
  // Continuously poll all interfaces and route the traffic between them
  MIDI_Interface::updateAll();
}
```

## Feature overview

This library turns your Arduino-compatible board into a MIDI control surface.  
Just connect some push buttons, potentiometers, LEDs ... and declare them in
your code.

The following sections give a brief overview of the features of the library.

### MIDI Interfaces

 - **MIDI over USB**
 - **Serial MIDI** (e.g. 5-pin DIN MIDI)
 - **Debug MIDI** (prints out the messages in a readable format, and allows you
                   to input text based messages, like a MIDI monitor)
 - **MIDI over Bluetooth LE**
 - **AppleMIDI** over WiFi or Ethernet

<sub>→ [_MIDI Interfaces documentation_](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/dc/df0/group__MIDIInterfaces.html)</sub>

### MIDI Control Output

 - **Push buttons** and **toggle switches**
 - **Potentiometers**, **faders** and other analog sensors
 - **Rotary encoders**
 - **Scanning keyboard matrices**

Digital inputs are **debounced**, and analog inputs are filtered using 
**digital filters and hysteresis**. This results in high accuracy without noise,
without introducing latency.

These MIDI control outputs can be used to send MIDI notes, Control Change,
Pitch Bend, Program/Patch change, etc.

<sub>→ [_MIDI Output Elements documentation_](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/d7/dcd/group__MIDIOutputElements.html)</sub>

### MIDI Control Input

 - **LEDs** (e.g. to indicate whether a track is muted/armed/soloed)
 - **LED rings** (e.g. to indicate the position of a pan knob)
 - **LED strips** (using the [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) 
                   library)
 - **VU meters**
 - **OLED displays**
 - **7-segment displays**

A large portion of the **Mackie Control Universal** (MCU) protocol is 
implemented.

<sub>→ [_MIDI Input Elements documentation_](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/df/d8b/group__MIDIInputElements.html)</sub>

### Motorized faders

- **Motorized faders** are supported through the [tttapa/Control-Surface-Motor-Fader](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface-Motor-Fader) repository.

<sub>→ [_Control Surface Motor Fader documentation_](https://tttapa.github.io/Pages/Arduino/Control-Theory/Motor-Fader/)</sub>

### Bank support

All controls can be arranged in **banks**: for example, if you have only 4
physical faders, you can make them bankable, so they can be used to control
the volume of many more different tracks. Changing banks can be done using push
buttons, rotary encoders, etc.  
Apart from banks and bank selectors, you can also add **transposers** to change 
the key of your notes, for example.

### Extended input/output

In order to save some IO pins, the library natively supports **multiplexers** 
(e.g. 74HC4051 or 74HC4067) to read many switches or potentiometers, 
**Shift Registers** (e.g. 74HC595) to drive many LEDs, **MAX7219 LED drivers**,
etc.

<sub>→ [_Extended IO documentation_](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/db/dd3/group__AH__ExtIO.html)</sub>

### Audio

If you are using a Teensy 3.x or 4.x, you can use it as a 
**USB audio interface**. Just add an I²S DAC (e.g. PCM5102) and 5 lines of code,
and you can start playing audio through your Teensy, by combining Control 
Surface with the Teensy Audio library.  
You can also add volume controls and VU meters for these audio connections.

<sub>→ [_Teensy Audio documentation_](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/d3/d5c/group__Audio.html)</sub>

### Modular and extensible

Thanks to the structure of the library, you can easily add your own MIDI or 
display elements, using some minimal, high level code. All low level stuff is
completely **reusable** (e.g. all MIDI operations, debouncing switches, 
filtering analog inputs, and so on).

## Supported boards

For each commit, the continuous integration tests compile the examples for the
following boards:

- Arduino UNO
- Arduino Mega
- Arduino Leonardo
- Teensy 3.2
- Teensy 4.1
- Arduino Due

## Change log and updating

### 2.x

- ([fae1933](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/3ae51946d57e27f0e37d001bb8e0ce418fae1933))  
   Completely refactored `BluetoothMIDI_Interface`, with support for the NimBLE and ArduinoBLE backends.
- ([ba7f42e](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/9c4cdd452990c470ee429b3121bdeb178ba7f42e))  
   More upper case constants and enumerators have been deprecated. For example,
   `ControlChange` should be used instead of `CONTROL_CHANGE`. If you continue
   using the old versions, you will get a compiler warning. These old versions
   will be removed in a future version of Control Surface.
- ([aaf6eea](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/aaf6eea2206c6e3b6a2004e0520100342945983f))  
   The upper case `CHANNEL_x` and `CABLE_x` constants have been deprecated in
   favor of the title case versions `Channel_x` and `Cable_x`. This was done to
   avoid conflicts with macros defined by the ArduinoCore-renesas.  
   For the same reason, the `CS` namespace has been renamed to `cs`.
- ([47b2d5e](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/47b2d5e7530da4c940fc99e606cfad0c6a0638a2))  
   The `Encoder` class has been replaced by [`AHEncoder`](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/dd/da9/classAHEncoder.html).
   The code has been cleaned up and support was added for newer boards like the
   Raspberry Pi Pico.
- ([c35f29c](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/c35f29ced7f3e491467bd61c1c71013099c01091))  
   The SoftwareSerial MIDI interfaces are now in separate header files that have
   to be included explicitly if you want to use them. The headers in question 
   are [`SoftwareSerialMIDI_Interface.hpp`](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/d3/df2/SoftwareSerialMIDI__Interface_8hpp.html)
   and [`SoftwareSerialDebugMIDI_Interface.hpp`](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/de/d83/SoftwareSerialDebugMIDI__Interface_8hpp.html).
   This prevents redefinition errors of pin change interrupt vectors even if
   SoftwareSerial is not used.
- ([bf8fb66](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/bf8fb661fa97fb6420584362bfcee7ce67939f59))  
   The abbreviated MIDI send functions (such as `sendCC()`) have been deprecated
   in favor of the full names (e.g. `sendControlChange()`). See the 
   [MIDI_Sender documentation](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/d6/d72/classMIDI__Sender.html)
   for a full overview.
- ([cf32e7e](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/cf32e7e72d81269e97f18ba51c42ba10715d1852))  
   `Control_Surface.setMIDIInputCallbacks()` now takes four arguments instead of
   three, because a System Common callback was added.
- ([b727931](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/b727931a44cb1e262ac32901f1e307583da90624))  
   The MIDI note name for the note F has been changed from `F` to `F_` in order
   to avoid conflicts with the `F()` macro and its functional equivalent 
   introduced [here](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/blob/7a8d3ee46262d943f7cc1158f8bce06f61c3ddb2/cores/arduino/Arduino.h#L35-L41).  
   It is now recommended to use `MIDI_Notes::C(4)` instead of `note(C, 4)`.
- ([a81bd19](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/a81bd1927298decc2ea3852fd2f00e8028c14b81))  
   Classes that make use of the SPI interface now require you to pass the `SPI`
   object as a constructor argument. This allows you to use `SPI1` or `SPI2`
   (if available for your hardware).
- ([c6e35b9](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/c6e35b960ac15bc1b5cf5c588139d437ccd9cb68))  
   The `NoteBitmapDisplay` class has been renamed to `BitmapDisplay`.
- ([37b6901](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/37b6901cbe56babc47c297a132381d53deaa45e8))  
   The `NoteValueLED` and `CCValueLED` classes (and similar) have been replaced
   by `NoteLED` and `CCLED` respectively.  
   The display elements `BitmapDisplay`, `VPotDisplay`, `VUDisplay` etc. are 
   now generic in the type of value that they display. In most cases, you should
   be able to update your sketch by adding `<>` after the type names, e.g. 
   `BitmapDisplay<>`, `VPotDisplay<>`, etc.
- ([1a21d13](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/1a21d1344f57066fa1eda3819eaf89cbbc79c14e))  
   The line numbers of `LCDDisplay` are now one-based: `1` is the first line and
   `2` is the second line. This is more consistent with the track parameter and
   the API of the rest of the library. (Before, the first line was `0` and the
   second line was `1`.)
- ([40e3d7a](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/40e3d7a4377b281e58dd7725f1bb8c6198855ce6))  
   Control Surface now comes with an Encoder library out of the box. You no 
   longer have to install or include `Encoder.h` in your sketches.

### 1.x

- ([8a3b1b3](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/8a3b1b314cf5b4aedf3ad60cbbc492fbcbb25c73))  
   Before, `Control_Surface.MIDI()` was used to get the MIDI interface used by
   Control Surface. This method was removed, because you can now connect 
   multiple interfaces to Control Surface, using the 
   [MIDI Pipe routing system](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/df/d72/classMIDI__Pipe.html#details).
   To send MIDI using Control Surface, you can now use 
   `Control_Surface.sendCC(...)` and the other similar methods directly.
- ([8a3b1b3](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/8a3b1b314cf5b4aedf3ad60cbbc492fbcbb25c73))  
   For the same reason as the bullet above, the `MultiMIDI_Interface` was
   removed, and has been replaced by the
   [MIDI Pipe routing system](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/df/d72/classMIDI__Pipe.html#details).
- ([bca6e11](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/bca6e11b2b3e02df5f600f65c81676708a81155b))  
   The color mapper for `NoteRangeFastLED` and the like now takes a second 
   parameter that represents the index of the LED within the LED strip.
- ([3c01c7d](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/3c01c7d5eb60e59720540d5a77095468e6984a58))  
   The **maximum supported ADC resolution is now used by default** (e.g. 13 bits
   on Teensy 3.x, 12 bits on ESP32).  
   This increases the accuracy of analog inputs and controls for the Control 
   Surface library, but could cause problems if your code uses other libraries
   that expect the resolution to be 10 bits.  
   You can change the default resolution to 10 bits in 
   [`src/AH/Settings/Settings.hpp`](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/dc/d69/namespaceAH.html#a4f2ec536d7413c6969f44d63ba14ce55)
   if you have to.
- ([31edaa6](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface/commit/31edaa6b76477fdf152c19fd34f7e4e8506561e6))  
   The **mapping function** is now applied before applying hysteresis.  
   This means that the input and output values of the function should be 
   16 - `ANALOG_FILTER_SHIFT_FACTOR` bits wide instead of 7. By default this is
   **14 bits**. You can get the maximum value in a portable way by using the
   `FilteredAnalog<>::getMaxRawValue()` function.  
   The signature of the mapping function is now `analog_t f(analog_t raw)`, 
   where the return value and raw are both numbers in [0, 16383] by default.
